# Pseudocodes
Pseudocodes for the commands of VFI Toolkit

Just a pdf that contains pseudocodes so you can understand what exactly specific VFI Toolkit commands are doing. (Only contains a few, request via discourse.vfitoolkit.com and I will add pseudocode for any command you want to see; this is a work in progress.)
